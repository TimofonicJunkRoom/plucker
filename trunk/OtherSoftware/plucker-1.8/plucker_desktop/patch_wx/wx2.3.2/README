// Purpose:     The is a directory listing of files of a wx distribution that have been
//              modified, along with where they should be installed, and what was 
//              changed in them and why. [Note: eventually, these may be accepted into 
//              the wx CVS and thus no longer distributed here]..

fileconf.cpp -- <your wx root dir>/src/common/fileconf.cpp

[ Added style for not escaping characters (so DOS names wouldn't list as C:\\whatever in 
key values) ]

confbase.h   -- <your wx root dir>/include/wx/confbase.h
[ Added style for not escaping characters (so DOS names wouldn't list as C:\\whatever in 
key values) ]

filedlgg.cpp --- <your wx root dir>/src/generic/filedlgg.cpp
[ Removed the reading and writing to config of filenames, as the / in a section name
crashes the parser ].

datetime.cpp -- <your wx root dir>/src/common/datetime.cpp
[ A CVS fix that was preventing parsing of leading zero dates]

tbarbase.cpp -- <your wx root dir>/src/common/tbarbase.cpp
[ A CVS fix to wipe the status bar on tool empty, not try to set the status text if there isn't one]

listctrl.cpp -- <your wx root dir>/src/generic\listctrl.cpp
[ Removal of minimum column width to allow drawing of zero-width columns in the showcase. ]
[ This one is probably temporary, the showcase should load as a separate config object, like the main listctrl. ]
