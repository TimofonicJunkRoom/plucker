// Purpose:     The is a directory listing of files of a wx distribution that have been
//              modified, along with where they should be installed, and what was 
//              changed in them and why. [Note: eventually, these may be accepted into 
//              the wx CVS and thus no longer distributed here]..

fileconf.cpp --> <your wx root dir>\src\common\fileconf.cpp
confbase.h   --> <your wx root dir>\include\wx\confbase.h
[ Added style for not escaping characters (so DOS names wouldn't list as C:\\whatever in 
key values) ]


filedlgg.cpp --- <your wx root dir>\src\generic\filedlgg.cpp
[ Removed the reading and writing to config of filenames, as the / in a section name
crashes the parser ].
