Note: It is recommended that you use the up to date version of wxWindows to compile, 
as alot of bugs have been fixed.

These directories provide some files as a convenience for old versions. They will
disappear soon.

All these patches are now part of wxWindows, except for the listctrl.cpp code, which
is only cosmetic, and showcase will end up using a different implementation anyway, as
zero-width columns aren't very portable.
