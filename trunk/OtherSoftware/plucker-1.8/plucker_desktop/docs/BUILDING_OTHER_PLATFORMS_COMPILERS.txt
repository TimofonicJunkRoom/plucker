Your C++ compiler.

COMPILATION
-----------

-Build the wxWindows library according to the instructions found with
 that distribution.
-Build the XML resource library (xrc) (in /contrib of the wxWindows 
 distribution).
-Test that things set up properly by compiling some of the wxWindows samples,
 and building the XML resources sample (in /contrib/samples/xrc).
-Optinally: open up /plucker_desktop/setup.h and flick compilation
 switches as desired. Most important one is the one to say whether
 want to use the styled text control or the normal text ctrl.
-Run the makefile for plucker-desktop, or if neccessary, use the 
 makefile.g95 for plucker-desktop and the makefiles that come in the
 wxWindows examples to write the makefile for your compiler. 
 Makefiles are already written for Linux, Cygwin, and
